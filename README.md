# Game-Shoppe
Steam competitor for Windows, Mac, and Linux with Zero DRM

# How Game-Shoppe will work
Game-Shoppe is a new emerging indie game storefront. We have a major anti-DRM stance, and we hate it. We are fed up with Steam's monopoly and itch.io not being a very stable platform. We take 0% fees and rely 100% on donations to run.
# How do you access Game-Shoppe?
Currently though our website, at [[https://game-shoppe.pages.dev]]. We do plan to release an Electron based app which will have game launcher functions. 
# How do I donate?
Donations will open later on.
